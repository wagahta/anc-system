# Deep Learning-Based Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) System

## Project Overview
This project implements a complete deep learning-based Active Noise Cancellation system... [Add 1-2 sentences describing the project's main goal].

## Key Features
- Feature 1 (e.g., Custom STFT implementation)
- Feature 2 (e.g., Hybrid CNN-LSTM model)
- Feature 3 (e.g., Comprehensive performance evaluation)

## Installation and Usage
### Running in Google Colab
1. Upload the `ANC_System_Implementation.ipynb` file to Google Colab.
2. Run the cells sequentially from top to bottom.

### Running Locally
1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/anc-system.git`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the main script: `python main.py`

## Results
The system achieves significant noise reduction. Below is a visualization of the training history:
